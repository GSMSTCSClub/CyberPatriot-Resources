      <string id="AllowTelemetry">Allow Telemetry</string>
      <string id="AllowTelemetry_0">0 - Security [Enterprise Only]</string>
      <string id="AllowTelemetry_1">1 - Required</string>
      <string id="AllowTelemetry_2">2 - Enhanced</string>
      <string id="AllowTelemetry_3">3 - Optional</string>
      <string id="AllowTelemetry_Explain">By configuring this setting in Windows 10, end users will not be able to opt into a higher level of telemetry collection than the level you have set for your organization.  This limitation applies only to the Windows operating system and apps included with Windows, and does not apply to third-party apps running on Windows 10.

Diagnostic data is categorized into four levels, as follows:
  - 0 (Security). Information that’s required to help keep Windows, Windows Server, and System Center secure, including data about the Connected User Experiences and Telemetry component settings, the Malicious Software Removal Tool, and Windows Defender.
  - 1 (Required). Basic device info, including: quality-related data, app compatibility, and data from the Security level.
  - 2 (Enhanced). Additional insights, including: how Windows, Windows Server, System Center, and apps are used, how they perform, advanced reliability data, and data from both the Required and the Security levels.
  - 3 (Optional). All data necessary to identify and help to fix problems, plus data from the Security, Required, and Enhanced levels.

Options available to users in the Settings app are changed by configuring this setting, and even if not set, may be impacted by other group policy settings.  Note that if this policy is configured to allow a telemetry setting of Security or Basic, end users will be unable to select a higher level.
      </string>

      <string id="TelemetryProxy">Configure Connected User Experiences and Telemetry</string>
      <string id="TelemetryProxy_Explain">With this policy setting, you can forward Connected User Experience and Telemetry requests to a proxy server.

If you enable this policy setting, you can specify the FQDN or IP address of the destination device within your organization’s network (and optionally a port number, if desired). The connection will be made over a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection.  If the named proxy fails, or if you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Connected User Experience and Telemetry data will be sent to Microsoft using the default proxy configuration.

The format for this setting is &lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt; 
      </string>

      <string id="CommercialId">Configure the Commercial ID</string>
      <string id="CommercialId_Explain">This policy setting defines the identifier used to uniquely associate this device’s telemetry data as belonging to a given organization. If your organization is participating in a program that requires this device to be identified as belonging to your organization then use this setting to provide that identification. The value for this setting will be provided by Microsoft as part of the onboarding process for the program. 

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, then Microsoft will not be able to use this identifier to associate this machine and its telemetry data with your organization.
      </string>

      <string id="DisableEnterpriseAuthProxy">Configure Authenticated Proxy usage for the Connected User Experience and Telemetry service</string>
      <string id="DisableEnterpriseAuthProxy_1">Enable Authenticated Proxy usage</string>
      <string id="DisableEnterpriseAuthProxy_2">Disable Authenticated Proxy usage</string>
      <string id="DisableEnterpriseAuthProxy_Explain">This policy setting blocks the Connected User Experience and Telemetry service from automatically using an authenticated proxy to send data back to Microsoft on Windows 10. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the Connected User Experience and Telemetry service will automatically use an authenticated proxy to send data back to Microsoft. Enabling this policy will block the Connected User Experience and Telemetry service from automatically using an authenticated proxy.</string>

      <string id="LimitEnhancedDiagnosticDataWindowsAnalytics">Limit Enhanced diagnostic data to the minimum required by Windows Analytics</string>
      <string id="LimitEnhancedDiagnosticDataWindowsAnalytics_1">Enable Windows Analytics collection</string>
      <string id="LimitEnhancedDiagnosticDataWindowsAnalytics_2">Disable Windows Analytics collection</string>
      <string id="LimitEnhancedDiagnosticDataWindowsAnalytics_Explain">This policy setting, in combination with the Allow Telemetry policy setting, enables organizations to send Microsoft a specific set of diagnostic data for IT insights via Windows Analytics services.

To enable this behavior, you must complete two steps:

    1. Enable this policy setting
    2. Set Allow Telemetry to level 2 (Enhanced)

This setting has no effect on devices configured to send Security or Required diagnostic data to Microsoft. 

When these policies are configured, diagnostic data collection will be limited to required diagnostic data and the events required by Desktop Analytics.  These events can be viewed at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2116020.

If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, then the level of diagnostic data sent to Microsoft is determined by the Allow Telemetry policy setting if it is configured (e.g. if you enable enhanced diagnostic data via the Allow Telemetry policy setting, but do not configure this policy setting, you'll send the required events for Windows Analytics, plus any additional Enhanced level diagnostic data to Microsoft).
      </string>

      <string id="AllowDeviceNameInDiagnosticData">Allow device name to be sent in Windows diagnostic data</string>
      <string id="AllowDeviceNameInDiagnosticData_Explain">This policy allows the device name to be sent to Microsoft as part of Windows diagnostic data.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, then device name will not be sent to Microsoft as part of Windows diagnostic data.
      </string>

      <string id="ConfigureTelemetryOptInSettingsUx">Configure telemetry opt-in setting user interface.</string>
      <string id="ConfigureTelemetryOptInSettingsUx_1">Disable telemetry opt-in Settings</string>
      <string id="ConfigureTelemetryOptInSettingsUx_2">Enable telemetry opt-in Setings</string>
      <string id="ConfigureTelemetryOptInSettingsUx_Explain">This policy setting determines whether an end user can change telemetry levels in Settings.

If you set this policy setting to "Disable Telemetry opt-in Settings", telemetry levels are disabled in Settings, and prevents end users from changing them.

If you don’t configure this policy setting, or you set it to "Enable Telemetry opt-in Settings”, end users can change the device telemetry level in the Settings app.

Note:
To set a limit on the level of diagnostic data that is sent to Microsoft by your organization, use the Allow Telemetry policy setting.

      <string id="ConfigureTelemetryOptInChangeNotification_Explain">
          This policy setting controls whether a device shows notifications about telemetry levels to people on first logon or when changes occur in Settings. 
          If you set this policy setting to "Disable telemetry change notifications", telemetry level notifications stop appearing.
          If you set this policy setting to "Enable telemetry change notifications" or don't configure this policy setting, telemetry notifications appear at first logon and when changes occur in Settings.
      </string>

      <string id="DisableDeviceDelete">Disable deleting diagnostic data </string>
      <string id="DisableDeviceDelete_Explain">
          This policy setting controls whether the Delete diagnostic data button is enabled in Diagnostic &amp; Feedback Settings page.
          If you enable this policy setting, the Delete diagnostic data button will be disabled in Settings page, preventing the deletion of diagnostic data collected by Microsoft from the device. 
          If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, the Delete diagnostic data button will be enabled in Settings page, which allows people to erase all diagnostic data collected by Microsoft from that device.
      </string>

      <string id="DisableDiagnosticDataViewer">Disable diagnostic data viewer. </string>
      <string id="DisableDiagnosticDataViewer_Explain">
